# Logic-Gate-Recogniser

This project, written as part of my dissertation aims to explore recognising logic gates sketch to the canvas, connecting them with inputs and outputs, then simulating them using either sequential or combinatorial logic. The seven base logic gates are supported: `Not, Or, Nor, And, Nand, Xor, Xnor` with two additional gates, `Input and Output` added to build circuits.
